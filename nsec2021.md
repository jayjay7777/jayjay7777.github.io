## NorthSec 2021 CTF - may 2021

### Intro
I regurarly participate to some CTFs, online and on-site. 
It was my 4th experience at NorthSec.

Due to Covid-19, the event was 100% online. 
Still, the yearly event stays the most immersive and the most complete CTF I'm participating to.
There is always a main scenario with many different tracks, including: trivia, RE, web, crypto, hardware (badge hacking), programming, forensics...

The NSEC team always delivers: check [nsec.io](https://nsec.io) !

### Scoreboard / team SummerJedi
With the team SummerJedi team, we ended 33 on 84 (nearly 30 on 84, as we unlocked a 3pts flag, but 15 min late :P )
We are satisfied with the result as, we were ~6 people while the max was 20, amd, none of us is a professionnal pentester.
